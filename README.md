# Brain Games
"Brain Games" is a project with five games. All five games simulate tasks performed by novice programmers. The principle is very simple: the game asks you a question, and you try to answer it correctly. This happens three times. If you answer all three questions, celebrate, for you've won. If not, you have an unlimited number of attempts to play again and win.

## Install
Copy and run the command below in terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apriakhin/python-project-49.git
cd python-project-49
make install
make build
make package-install
```

## Even
You will be shown a random number. You need to answer yes if the number is even and no if it is odd.

To run, use the command:
```sh
brain-even
```

## Calc
You will be shown a mathematical problem. You need to write the answer.

To run, use the command:
```sh
brain-calc
```
Example:

## Gcd
You will be given two numbers. You need to determine the greatest common divisor.

To run, use the command:
```sh
brain-gcd
```
Example:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/39iIV70o1w7u5kXMSEJ2Gx04Q.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/39iIV70o1w7u5kXMSEJ2Gx04Q)

## Progression
You will be shown a list of numbers in a certain progression, with one number missing. You need to identify the missing number.

To run, use the command:
```sh
brain-progression
```
Example:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/WG5IM56Lay45y90lubo3Ll9wO.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/WG5IM56Lay45y90lubo3Ll9wO)

## Prime
You will be shown a random number. You need to answer yes if the number is prime and no if it is composite.

To run, use the command:
```sh
brain-prime
```
Example:
